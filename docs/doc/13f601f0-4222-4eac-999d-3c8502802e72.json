The image communicates to the model the current state of the world, i.e. assuming the model runs at three hertz, every 333 milliseconds, we feed the latest RGB image from a robot workspace camera into the model to obtain the next action to take.\nPlease note that the model currently does not take in additional camera images such as wrist camera images, in hand camera images, or depth.\n### Explanation of action space\nThe action dimensions we consider include seven variables for the gripper movement (x, y, z, roll, pitch, yaw, opening of the gripper). Each variable represents the absolute value, the delta change to the dimension value or the velocity of the dimension."
